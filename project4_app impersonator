/* Project: App impersonator

Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc.
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!),
and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app. */

/* What does the app's SQL look like? */

CREATE TABLE tiktok (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT,
    followers INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO tiktok (username, followers)
    VALUES ("Barbie", 45);
INSERT INTO tiktok (username, followers)
    VALUES ("Bestdressed", 100);
INSERT INTO tiktok (username, followers)
    VALUES ("Kaiti Yoo", 70);
INSERT INTO tiktok (username, followers)
    VALUES ("Ken", 30);
INSERT INTO tiktok (username, followers)
    VALUES ("Nyna Sabrina", 150);
    
SELECT * FROM tiktok;

UPDATE tiktok SET username = "ninskins" WHERE username = "Nyna Sabrina";

SELECT * FROM tiktok;

DELETE FROM tiktok WHERE username = "Ken";

SELECT * FROM tiktok;
